        <p>Most recently, I was a <a className="hover-black" href="https://routes.rungoapp.com/">Web Developer at RunGo</a>, a platform allowing users to create custom voice-navigated running routes. I worked particularly on improving user experience features for RunGoâ€™s Route Creator site. Highlights included creating a custom image overlay tool, improving print map, complete route tool, full screen edit mode, logbook integration with Strava API, and ensuring
          responsive design.
